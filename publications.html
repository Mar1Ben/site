      -- Research project: The ALICE experiment at CERN LHC was designed to study heavy ion collisions as well as proton collisions. Electromagnetic interactions are present in such collisions; The electromagnetic field of a charged particle moving at ultrarelativistic velocities can be considered as a photon cloud that surrounds the particle. The photon cloud of a projectile nucleus can interact with the entire target nucleus, its constituents or its photon cloud, giving as result the production of new particles. To distinguish these processes from hadronic processes a condition in the impact parameter is required, it must be bigger than the raddi sum of colliding particles. Collisions that met this requirement are called ultraperipheral. The study of $\tau$-$\tau$ photoproduction at ALICE in ultraperiperipheral Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{S_{NN}} = 5.02 TeV$ is presented. The report is available <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362420560_SEARCH_FOR_NEW_PHYSICS_WITH_ULTRA-PERIPHERAL_COLLISIONS_IN_ALICE">here.</a>.

      -- Research project: The aim of this project is to perform a typical analysis in particle physics: having a model of signal and background (in the form of generated ”Monte Carlo” events – MC samples), figure out a selection criteria that can be applied on data events to suppress the background contribution. The report is availabe <a href="Project_2.pdf">here.</a>. You can download the codes of this project by <a href="Project_2_codes.tar.gz">clic here.</a>.<br>
      -- Research project: The objective of this project is to analyse data coming from the Higgs boson decay to double photons and getting the mass of this hypothetical particle. You can download the codes of this project by <a href="Project_3_codes.tar.gz">clic here.</a>.<br>
      -- Master thesis entitled Neutrino Physics with KM3NeT experiment: The objective of this work is to study theoretically and experimentally the masses and oscillations of neutrinos. In the first part we described the masses of the neutrinos in the standard model as well as their interactions according to the latter. In the second part we talked about the work of Arthur B. McDonald and Takaaki Kajita and neutrino oscillations. In the third part, we explained the KM3NeT experiment, which has two large detectors, namely ORCA installed in France, of which we will explain its operating principle, and ARCA, which is installed in Italy, of which we will say a few words very briefly. In the last part we process KM3NeT data to obtain constraints on the masses and the neutrino oscillation parameters. The report is available <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354640423_Neutrino_physics_with_the_KM3NeT_detector">here.</a>.<br>
      -- Bachelor thesis entitled Particle matter interaction and multi-detectors: This project has two objectives, the first objective of this project was to understand the interactions between particles at the small scales and how to study the energy deposited in materials via Beth-Bloch formula. The second objective was to understand how $4\pi$ detectors work. We chose two examples which are ATLAS and CMS. The report is available <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348842906_Interaction_particules_matiere_et_multi-detecteurs">here.</a>.<br>
